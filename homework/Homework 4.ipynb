    "In this problem we would like to learn to distinguish Ising samples from well below or above the critical temperature. To do so:\n",

To do so, generate $10,000$ samples for all $T$ in $[1.0,1.5,2.0,2.5,3.0,3.5.,4.0,4.5,5.0]$ and plot the average network prediction and error bars on these samples as a function of $T$.

    "\n",
    "In class, we classified galaxies as spiral, elliptical, or unknown using a convolutional neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we would like to get a sense of how architecture differences affect performance. In class, we did the principled architecture of image data, a CNN, but we want to see if performance goes down by using another architecture instead. Specifically, we would like to compare performance of a CNN vs. depth $1$ feedforward neural network with ReLU non-linearity. I recommend using PyTorch for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modify the code from class to utilize a feedforward neural network with ReLU non-linearity. Note that you will have to *squish* the image output to instead be one vector, therefore removing all the local information from the image that CNNs learn from. At the end, run `print(model)`, where `model = YourModelClass()`.\n",
    "2. Change the width so that the number of parameters of this FFNN is *roughly* equal to that of the CNN from class. Alternatively, scale up the size of the CNN so that it has roughly the same number of parameters as the FFNN. Trainable parameters in PyTorch can be computed using `sum(p.numel() for p in model.parameters() if p.requires_grad)`. Print the number of trainable parameters for both models.\n",
    "3. Write a training loop for training the NN on the same training data as the CNN, with a variety of train-test splits for both [(90%,10%), (75%,25%), (50%,50%), (25%, 75%), (10%, 90%)]. You should keep track of / plot your train loss as a function of epochs so you know when to appropriately stop training. IMPORTANT: if you run into problems during training, such as `nan` or outrageous / boring predictions, it could be that your network is suffering from *vanishing or exploding gradients*. This can be mitigated by tuning your learning rate if it's too small or too large, adding `weight_decay` in Adam, and / or adding batch normalization (see PyTorch docs).\n",
    "4. Make one plot for each **label**. On each plot, show the test-set accuracy of the CNN and the FFNN as a function of the train-test split, with different colors for the different architectures. Display these plots nicely in a grid. Comment on if you see any trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: PyTorch requires you setting a `device` to perform computation on. If running on an Apple ARM machine, use: `device = torch.device(\"mps\" if torch.backends.mps.is_available else \"cpu\")`. If running on a local GPU or on discovery, use: `device = torch.device(\"cuda:0\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\")`.\n",
